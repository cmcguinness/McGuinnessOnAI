# Brainstormer

This is a demonstration using OpenAI's ChatGPT where we feed it data from Salesforce about an open opportunity and ChatGPT returns suggested actions to us.

There are two .json files, both are datapacks, which contain a DataRaptor, Integration Procedure, and OmniScript.  If you are using an org with an "omnistudio" namespace for OmniStudio, use the *omnistudio* file. Otherwise, import the *vlocity* file.

The integration procedure will have to be activated to run the demo, and you need to supply an Opportunity Id as the Context Id of the OmniScript.
